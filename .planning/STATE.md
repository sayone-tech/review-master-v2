# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-01)

**Core value:** Org Admins and Staff can view, respond to, and action Google reviews — backed by Celery background sync, AI enrichment, and an Action Items workflow.
**Current focus:** Phase 11 — Reviews Fetching, Display, Reply

## Current Position

Phase: 10 (Infrastructure Foundation) — COMPLETE
Next: Phase 11 (Reviews Fetching, Display, Reply)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 9.5 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.96 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 6. Org Admin Shell | 4/5 | 35m | 8.75m |
| 7. Regions | 0/3 | - | - |
| 8. Shops | 1/5 | 12m | 12m |
| 9. Team | 0/5 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 06-01 (9m), 06-02 (6m), 06-03 (15m), 06-04 (5m)
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 10 P01 | 7 | 3 tasks | 11 files |
| Phase 10 P03 | 35 | 3 tasks | 20 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- v0.3 roadmap: Celery tasks are thin wrappers over service functions; three-layer idempotency for all background work
- v0.3 roadmap: Channels surface kept narrow — only SyncProgressConsumer in Phase 11
- v0.3 roadmap: Cost calculation locked at log time using time-versioned AiPricing; historical costs never retroactively changed
- v0.3 roadmap: OpenAI idempotency — enrich_review exits if enrichment_status is already SUCCESS or IN_PROGRESS
- v0.3 roadmap: LangSmith is best-effort; if unreachable, OpenAI call still proceeds
- v0.3 roadmap: Single Celery Beat instance; Flower never in production
- [Phase 09-05]: ConfirmModal uses open= prop (not isOpen=)
- [Phase 09-05]: Enable flow is inline in TeamModals; no confirmation modal
- [Phase 10]: @shared_task(bind=True) uses type: ignore[misc] + Any for self — mypy strict mode has no stubs for celery decorators
- [Phase 10]: celery + django-celery-beat added to pre-commit mypy additional_dependencies so isolated hook env can load Django settings
- [Phase 10]: Shop uses integer PK — WebSocket routing uses <int:shop_id>, not <uuid:shop_id> as plan specified
- [Phase 10]: channels stubs typed as Any — AsyncJsonWebsocketConsumer subclass and database_sync_to_async get type: ignore[misc] consistent with celery decorator pattern

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 8: GBP API production approval from Google is a non-code prerequisite for production launch (code can be built and tested against sandbox first).
